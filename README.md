You can install stow and just go `cd dotfiles;stow .` to have all my configuration add `--adopt` flag to overwrite your previous config. You will need to install some additional packages. Creating the list soon.

Everything should work theoretically except the scripts you need to change the icons to the absolute paths. Icons come with the repo just change "/home/ankush/" with your path. The scripts are located in ".local/bin/"
